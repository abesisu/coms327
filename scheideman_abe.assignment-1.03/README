Dijkstra's path algorithm is now calculated!

Dijkstra's shortest path is calculated for rival and hiker trainer types.
The cost maps are printed out for each map, which when followed, will
lead the trainer's to the PC while respecting their movement limitations.

This project includes map.c, map.h, path.c, path.h, world.h, play.c, a Makefile,
this README, a CHANGELOG file, and Dr. Schaeffer's heap.c and heap.h.

To test the features, run make then ./play

To create a tarball, run

make clean - in this directory
tar cvfz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.03.tar.gz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.03 - from the parent directory
