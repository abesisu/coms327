Characters are now added to the map!

There are now any number of characters desired and the PC added to the map.
There are hikers and rivals which path to the PC, pacers that go back and
forth, swimmers that stay in the water, explorers that go almost anywhere,
wanderers that stay in their region, and sentries that don't move.

This project includes map.c, map.h, path.c, path.h, world.h, util.h main.c,
trainer.c, trainer.h, a Makefile, this README, a CHANGELOG file, and
Dr. Schaeffer's heap.c and heap.h.

To test the features, run make then ./play or ./play --numtrainers <integer>

To create a tarball, run:
make clean - in this directory
tar cvfz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.04.tar.gz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.04 - from the parent directory
