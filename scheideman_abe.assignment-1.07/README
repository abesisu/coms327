Parse in Pokemon data from a database!

The game now parses in data from 9 different CSV data files and can print out the 
information stored. 

To test the features, run make then ./play to parse in every file 
or ./play <object> where <object> is one of pokemon, moves, pokemon_moves,
pokemon_species, experience, type_names, pokemon_stats, stats or pokemon_types
to parse that file and print the data.

To create a tarball, run:
make clean - in this directory
tar cvfz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.07.tar.gz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.07 - from the parent directory
