Map generation now works! 

Using map.c and map.h, a random map is generated in an 80x21 grid.
The map contains an impenetrable border with one gate on each side, at least one region of grass,
water, mountains, and forests, at least two regions of tall-grass, a road going west to east, a
road going north to south, a Pokemart, and a Pokecenter.

This project includes map.c, map.h, a Makefile to build and run the project,
this README, and a CHANGELOG file. 

To test the feature, run make then ./map.

To create a tarball, run 

make clean - in this directory
tar cvfz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.01.tar.gz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.01 - from the parent directory
