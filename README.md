## Pokemon 

Over the course of the Spring 2023 semester, I will build a terminal-based version of Pok√©mon.

### Feature Update:
Battle system is now implemented!

```
The player will now encounter wild pokemon to capture them and battle other trainers!
```

To test the features, run `make` then `./play` to load the game. Traverse the world
to encounter pokemon and enter battles to see that Pokemon are loaded for npcs and the pc.
