## Pokemon 

Over the course of the Spring 2023 semester, I will build a terminal-based version of Pokemon.

### Feature Update:
Map generation now works! 

```
Using map.c and map.h, a random map is generated in an 80x21 grid.
The map contains an impenetrable border with one gate on each side, at least one region of grass,
water, mountains, and forests, at least two regions of tall-grass, a road going west to east, a
road going north to south, a Pokemart, and a Pokecenter.
```

To test the feature, run `make` then `./map`.
