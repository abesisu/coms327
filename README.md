## Pokemon 

Over the course of the Spring 2023 semester, I will build a terminal-based version of Pok√©mon.

### Feature Update:
Characters are now added to the map!

```
There are now any number of characters desired and the PC added to the map.
There are hikers and rivals which path to the PC, pacers that go back and 
forth, swimmers that stay in the water, explorers that go almost anywhere, 
wanderers that stay in their region, and sentries that don't move.
```

To test the feature, run `make` then `./play`.
To specify a certain number of trainers, run `make` then `./play --numtrainers <integer>`.
