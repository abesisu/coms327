## Pokemon 

Over the course of the Spring 2023 semester, I will build a terminal-based version of Pok√©mon.

### Feature Update:
Parse in Pokemon data from a database!

```
The game now parses in data from 9 different CSV data files and can print out the 
information stored. 
```

To test the features, run `make` then `./play` to parse in every file 
or `./play <object>` where <object> is one of pokemon, moves, pokemon_moves,
pokemon_species, experience, type_names, pokemon_stats, stats or pokemon_types
to parse that file and print the data.
