## Pokemon 

Over the course of the Spring 2023 semester, I will build a terminal-based version of Pokemon.

### Feature Update:
World map now implemented!

```
Using map.c, map.h, and play.c, the user can now traverse a 401 by 401 
array of maps. When a new location is visited, a random map is generated
that links up with the other maps around it. The maps are remembered as 
well.
```

To test the feature, run `make` then `./play`.
