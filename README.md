## Pokemon 

Over the course of the Spring 2023 semester, I will build a terminal-based version of Pok√©mon.

### Feature Update:
Dijkstra's path algorithm is now calculated!

```
Dijkstra's shortest path is calculated for rival and hiker trainer types.
The cost maps are printed out for each map, which when followed, will
lead the trainer's to the PC while respecting their movement limitations.
```

To test the feature, run `make` then `./play`.
