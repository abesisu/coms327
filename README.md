## Pokemon 

Over the course of the Spring 2023 semester, I will build a terminal-based version of Pok√©mon.

### Feature Update:
User Interfaces and PC movement is added!

```
The user can now move the PC and interact with a User Interface.
There are screens set up for battles, displaying trainer info, and 
entering buildings. Color is now added as well.
```

To test the feature, run `make` then `./play`.
To specify a certain number of trainers, run `make` then `./play --numtrainers <integer>`.
