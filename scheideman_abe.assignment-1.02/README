World map now implemented!

Using map.c, map.h, and play.c, the user can now traverse a 401 by 401 
array of maps. When a new location is visited, a random map is generated
that links up with the other maps around it. The maps are remembered as 
well.

This project includes map.c, map.h, play.c, a Makefile, this README, and
a CHANGELOG file.

To test the features, run make then ./play

To create a tarball, run

make clean - in this directory
tar cvfz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.02.tar.gz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.02 - from the parent directory
