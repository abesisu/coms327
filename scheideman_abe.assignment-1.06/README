Files are in C++ and PC can move map to map!

The game now runs in C++. The user can traverse from map to map.
The user can also fly to different maps. There are a couple of known bugs
These are likely simple off by one errors that need a fine toothed combing
some other day. Flying doesn't take the user to the exact location, and 
going to east or west maps doesn't quite work either.

To test the features, run make then ./play or ./play --numtrainers <integer>

To create a tarball, run:
make clean - in this directory
tar cvfz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.06.tar.gz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.06 - from the parent directory
