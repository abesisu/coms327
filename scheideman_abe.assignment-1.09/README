Battle system is now implemented!

The player will now encounter wild pokemon to capture them and battle other trainers!

To test the features, run make then ./play to load the game. Traverse the world
to encounter pokemon and enter battles to see that Pokemon are loaded for npcs and the pc.

To create a tarball, run:
make clean - in this directory
tar cvfz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.09.tar.gz scheideman_abe.assignment-1.09 - from the parent directory
